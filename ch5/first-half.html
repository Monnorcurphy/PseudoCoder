  What is the difference between top down and bottom up?

  Top down- you start at the top and break the problem down until you are at the base level. Top down cannot be coded until the whole problem is understood, but this gives the problem a clear direction.

  Memoization is a key feature of the top down approach. You track the work that you have already done, and cache those values. If you have a cached value, then you use the pre computer answer.

  Bottom up- you start with small examples and build these examples up into larger and larger parts. You can begin programming bottom up problems immediately, but can cause a problem if you donâ€™t know how the problems are going to fit together.

  Dynamic programming is the process of picking what order your computations will go in, and working these values into the future of the algorithm.


  Show me the formula to determine a team of 11 people, out of 14 choices?

  If you have a team of 14 people, with only 11 open spots, how many possibilities are there?

  n!/ k!(n -k)!

  Why? What does that mean? Go through it one by one.

  In the first choice you have n options, then n -1, and so on.

  After we have selected a number of players, we have n - i choices left.

  What is that n-k! doing on the bottom? Order does not matter, unlike in other problems. Because a team with Johnson and Briggs, is the same as a team with Briggs and Johnson.

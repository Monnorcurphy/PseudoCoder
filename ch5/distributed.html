  <h2>Distributed Computing</h2>
  <h4>Back in the day</h4>
  <p>
    Distributed used to mean computers that were spread out in a
    geographic area, but today can mean autonomous processes that run
    on the same computer, and interact with each other by message
    passing.
  </p>

  <p>Today it means components located on connected/networked computers.
    Thes computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing
    messages. These components interact to achieve a common goal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Significant characteristics include concurrency of components,
    lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components.
  </p>

  <p>Low level- CPUs are connected via some sort of network, be it
    printed onto a circuit board or made up of loosely coupled devices.
    Higher level- A communication system must interconnect these
    processes running on those CPUs.
  </p>

  <p> A note on reliability. Distributed systems are more reliable.
    Many low end computers provide a lower chance of failure than one
    high end computer.
  </p>

  <h4>The subtle, and unclear distinctions</h4>

  <p>Concurrent computing, parallel computing, and distributed
    computing have a lot of overlap and no clear distinction. A system
    could be described as parallel and distributed. Distributed
    computing is a loosely coupled form of parallel computing (
    parallel computing- tight coupling of distributed).
  </p>

    <p>
      Distributed program is a distributed system that is run by a
      computer program. In distributed programming it is common for
      tasks to be partitioned out and solved by one, or more,
      computers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Parallel computing means all processors have access to a shared memory
      to exchange information. Distributed computing means each processor
      has its own private memory, and information is exchanged by
      passing messages between processors.
    </p>

    <h4>The forms of distributed computing</h4>
    <p>Distributed programming falls into some of these categories:
    </p>

    <h5>Client-server</h5>
    <p>Clients contact the server for data then format and display into
      the users. Permanent changes are committed back to the server. In
      this model work is done by a server, and is requested by a client.
      The server does the work and the client initiates the contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples: email, network printing, the world wide web.
    </p>

    <h5>Tier applications</h5>
    <p>Three-tier- Most web applications. Architectures that move the
      client intelligence to a middle client. Simplifies application
      deployment.
    </p>
    <p>N-tier- refer to web applications which further forward their
      requests to enterprise services. This lead to the success of
      application servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multi-tier architecture - client server architecture presentation,
      application processing, and data management functions are
      physically separated. Three tier is the most common.
    </p>
    <p>Examples: web development such as e-commerce website. A front end
      web server which delivers content. A middle content processing and
      generation level application server (Rails, Django, Flask). Then a
      backend database or data store, made up of data sets and database
      management systems software, which provides access to the data.
    </p>
    <h5>Peer to Peer</h5>
      <p>No special machines that provide a service or manage the
        network resources. Everyone is considered equal in doing the
        task. Uses include file sharing, instant and voice
        communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:  Skype, Napster
      </p>

  <h2>Array- A Single File Line</h2>
  <h4>Throughput</h4>
  <p>
    The maximum rate at which something can be produced or processed.
    Simply put, throughput is the amount of information a system can
    process in a given amount of time. Throughput can be affected by the
    physical medium, processing power, and end-user behavior.
    Some throughput definitions include network and system throughput.
  </p>
    <p>
    The network throughput is the rate of successful message delivery
    over a communication channel. The system throughput is sum of the
    data rates that are delivered to all terminals.
  </p>

  <h4>Latency</h4>
  <p>
    Time delay between the cause and effect of some physical change.
    Latency can never be faster than the speed of light, because of
    physics.
  </p>

  <h4>Router</h4>
  <p>
    A networking devices which forwards packets (bundles of information)
    between computer networks. In other words, they tell a computer how
    to get to a website.
  </p>

  <h4>IP Address</h4>
  <p>
    An unqiue identifier assigned to each internet connected device.
  </p>

  <h4>URL</h4>
  <p>
    Uniform resource locator, or more commonly known as a web address.
    This is the way humans look for websites, whereas computers look
    for websites and other internet resources via IP addresses.
  </p>
  <h4>DNS</h4>
  <p>
    Naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected
    to the internet.  It delegates the responsibility of assigning
    domain names, and mapping those names to servers. It is written in
    ASCII, which is troublesome for internationalized domain names. This
    problem was solved by IDNA, for more on that go here:

  </p>
  <h4>Daemon</h4>
  <p>
    Daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process, and
    to distinguish themselves they end in d, usually. This term comes
    from Maxwellâ€™s Demon (The one which breaks the second law of
    thermodynamics). It comes from the Greek, and therefore has no
    morality, unlike Christian Demons.

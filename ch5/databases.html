  <h2>Rendering, Servers, UX and UI design</h2>
  <h4>What is a server?</h4>
  <p> First, you must know what a client is. A client, is software or
    hardware which uses a server. A sever is just like a server....
    you know...in a restaurant. It provides data or resources to a client.
    So, an example may be that you want to look through Amazon for some
    shoes.
  </p>

  <p>
    You go online, and go to Amazon's website. Your browser is a client.
    The server, one of Amazon's computers, returns to you with the
    website. You go into the search bar and type in "shaes", because
    you do not know how to spell. Your browser, again the client, asks
    the server to retrieve all relevant information on "shaes."
  </p>

  <p>For most purposes, you can think of a server as a giant machine
    which holds lots of information. But, we need some way to retrieve
    this information.
  </p>

  <h4>Databases- NoSQL vs SQL</h4>
  <p> SQL, also known as Structured Query Language, is a langauge used
    for relational database management. WHAAA? Basically, SQL is a
    programming language that allows you to look up information across
    different tables. These tables are full of columns, holding information.
    These columns tie to other columns in the database, they are "related."
  </p>

  <p>
    SQL and relatonal databases are common, they are very rigid. They
    make data storage easy if you know what you need to store, and
    how information is related.
  </p>

  <p>Why you use a relational database:
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced anomalies</li>
      <li>Database integrity</li>
      <li>Your data is not changing</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p> NoSQL, is exactly what it sounds like, not only SQL, and
    a non-relational database. These databases are document oriented,
    which make them more easily accessible if you do not have a data
    schema yet, or you will be storing things like articles, photos,
    etc.
  </p>

  <p>NoSQL database are commonly used in big data and real-time web
    applications. They have a simple design, simpler horizontal scaling
    to clusters (this is a problem for relational databases), have finer
    control over availability. The data structures used by NoSQL are
    more flexible than relational database tables.
  </p>

  <p>Why you use a NOSQL database:
    <ul>
      <li>Large Volumes of data, with little to no structure</li>
      <li>Easier cloud computing</li>
      <li>Easy rapid development</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p> If NoSQL has all of these advantages, why has it not been adopted
    everywhere? Dude. Just. Stop.
  </p>

  <p>NoSQL has not been adopted because there is an inability to
    perform ad-hoc joins across tables, lack of standardized interfaces,
    and investments in relational databases. NoSQL offers “eventual
    consistency” which might result in stale reads, along with some data
    loss. Okay....but what did you just say?
  </p>

  <p> People have put money into relational databases, so it looks bad
    to switch after their investment. There are not many interfaces out
    there which make NoSQL easy to adopt. You may have some data which
    is not up to date when a user sees it, and you may lose some user
    data.
  </p>

  <h4>Client vs Server side rendering</h4>
  <p> When a webpage renders, there are currently two choices for
    who does the work of doing the work to make the page load. Either,
    your computer can do the work, or another person's computer does the
    work. What would be better about these approaches?
  </p>
  <p> Can't think of anything? That's okay. I hear that zookeepers
    make great money. If another person did the work of giving you the
    page, it means that page would be ready when you got there. Otherwise,
    your machine is now being told that it has to put this page together,
    and it was just minding its own busines...
  </p>
  <p> Search engines work by crawling the web. Basically they go around,
    looking at pages, and then determine if that page is relevant in some
    way. If your machine renders a page, a search engine can't really
    see it...can it?
  </p>
  <p> On the other hand, if you need a page to do something quickly,
    and your computer has to ask someone else what happens when you
    drag a slider, or click a button, it is going to take longer. If
    your computer knew how to handle those situations, then it would be
    faster and more dynamic.
  </p>

  <p> That is client versus server side rendering. Server side rendering
    is better because it can cache webpages, it is faster on the initial
    page load, and there are no special accomodations for search engine
    optimization. Client side rendering makes interactivity much easier,
    and faster. client side is also benefitial because you don’t need to
    request the whole web page, and allows only portions of the webpage
    to be updated.
  </p>

  <h4>Scaling- Up, or out?</h4>
  <p> If you have a lot of traffic on your website, and you want
    people to continue to be able to view that site, then the best
    thing you can do is figure out how you are going to scale. There are
    two choices, scale up, or scale out.
  </p>

  <p>Scaling up is the act of taking one machine, and making it as
    awesome as possible. Buying more RAM, better processors, etc. There
    is a limit to how "up" you can go. The benefits are, it is much
    cheaper to have 1 really great machine, than 14 moderate machines.
    If you hear someone use the word "multi-core concurrency", they
    are talking about scaling up.
  </p>
  <p>Scaling out is getting more computers to handle the problem.   Scaling
    out is more expensive, since you have to buy more machines, and deal
    with storage, cooling, etc. However, scaling out is considered to be
    "safer" since, if one machine fails, you have others to pick up
    the slack. If you here someone use the term "distributed computing"
    they are usually talking about scaling out.
  </p>

  <h4>UX vs UI</h4>
  <p>In the field of programming, there is often little to no distinction
    between these two terms. However, I am not a imbecile, so I am going
    to talk about the difference. UI means user interface, UX means
    user experience.
  </p>
  <p> If a website were a human body, then UI would be the skin, while
    UX would be the organs. UI is the presentation, UX is optimizations,
    and measuring. Let us discuss UX first, which existed before computers.
  </p>
  <p>UX used to be known as market research. UX designers often analyze
    competitors, customers, strategies, and content. UX designers
    need to do marketing, designing, and project management.
  </p>
  <p>UI the means by which the user and computer system interact. UI
    designers do customer analysis, design, and branding. User
    interface is the process of visually guiding the user through the
    product’s interface.

    <h2>How the Internet Works</h2>
    <h4>Your Computer</h4>

    <p>
      If you were in your house, but you needed to get a few things you
      would assign different tasks to your good for nothing housemates.
      Like if you needed to get eggs, you would give your daughter
      money, who would then give it to your wife (who you aren't fighting
      with, it's just you hate her face).
    </p>
     <p>Your wife, would give the money to your son, who would go buy eggs,
      and use the extra to buy beer. He would give the eggs to his mother,
      who would give it to your daughter, and then you could throw the
      eggs at your wife's car.
      <br>
      <br>
      That is how the internet works!
    </p>

    <p>
      Your computer sends a signal down the TCP/IP protocol stack. The
      signal goes from an application (your daughter) to the IP (your wife),
      down to the hardware layer (your son). The hardware layer breaks
      messages into binary and, if the messages are too large, into
      packets. Before we talk about where the packets go, let's talk about
      how your computer deals with packets.
    </p>

    <p>
      When your computer recieves packets, the hardware layer converts
      them from binary into whatever information (http, doc, etc.). It
      organizes this information and sends it to the IP layer. The IP
      then sends the information to the application, which handles the
      readability for you.
    </p>

    <h4>NSPs and ISPs</h4>
    <p>
      In order to get the eggs, your son had to drive on roads. These
      roads may be owned by California, or by a private citizen. And
      on his way he may have to take several different roads, made
      and owned by different people. This, in essence, is an NSP.
    </p>

    <p>
      NSPs (Network Service Providers) make up the backbone of the
      internet, which are required connect to Network Access Points (NAPs).
      When your packets reach a NAP, they may jump from one access point
      to another. Metropolitan Area Exchanges(MAEs), are like Network Access
      Points, but are privately owned. These two (NAPs and MAEs) make
      up Internet Exchange Points (IXs).
    </p>
    <p>
      NSPs sell bandwith to Internet Service Providers (ISPs). You
      have dealt with an ISP, as they are the ones who provide you
      access to the internet. So in essence, your ISP acts as a bully
      who stands outside your door, demanding a toll monthly so your son
      can buy eggs.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking for your Information</h4>
    <p>
      Now, let's say that your mom told your son to go to a specific
      market, like Safeway on the corner of 40th and Buena Vista. If
      your son didn't know how to get there, and he didn't have GPS, he
      may call a friend. If the friend didn't know, he could call someone
      else, until someone gave him directions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is how your computer finds your information. Your packets are
      sent to a router. The router looks to see if it knows where the
      IP address you are looking for is. If it does not, it asks another
      router, going up a chain, which will eventually stop at the NSP
      backbone.
    </p>

    <p>
      It gets slightly more complicated, since the name you use to find
      a website, and the one your computer is looking for is slightly
      different. You go to www.Iamsad.com, but your computer looks for
      an IP address, and the router it asks is called a Domain Name
      Service.
    </p>

    <p>
      A domain name service is a database (a list, if you want), which
      tracks different IP addresses. But, it cannot hold all of the IP
      addresses to the entire internet.
    </p>

    <h4>Other Pertinent Information</h4>
    <p> As you may, or may not know, there are many programming languages.
      Like English, Spanish, and other langauges, those languages
      have rules, which people choose to follow, or not. When your
      computer looks for a website, it requests this in HTTP protocol,
      which is not to be confused with HTML.
    </p>
    <p> HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language, which is how programmers
      present information on a webpage. HTTP is a protocol which
      determines how computers communicate over the world wide web, WWW.
      When you type a url into a page, you ping a DNS server, retrieves
      the data, and your computer parses it.
    </p>

    <h4>Putting it all together</h4>
    <p> When your computer gets information from a website, it goes
      down the TCP/IP stack, which sends packets through your ISPs
      routers. It goes through these routers, using the DNS, until
      it finds a web server. The web server responds with some HTTP,
      and your computer goes back up the TCP/IP stack to serve you the
      information. If that doesn't make sense, go back and re-read this
      page.

    <!--Firewalls -->
     <!-- Firewalls are a network security system which controls the incoming/outgoing traffic, based on some predetermined rules. Firewalls can either be network based, or host based. They can also be software based or hardware based.
    Network based firewalls can be WAN or LAN based (Local Area Network, or Wide Area Network). They are often daemon, services integrated into the operating system, or endpoint security protection.
    They can be network layer, application layer, proxies, or network address translation. Network layer means they monitor packets, and are only allowed past if they follow certain predefined rules.
    Application layer firewalls look at packets received and sent monitoring them for content. They work by determining if a process should accept a connection. -->

    <!--Proxies, VPNs  -->
    <!-- Proxies act as firewalls by responding to input packets (like connection requests) as an application firewall.
    Reverse Proxy- Retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers, and returns the information as if the proxy had the information. They can be useful to stop DDos. Can also spread out the load amongst multiple servers so that no one server gets overloaded, and can compress content.
    Denial of service attacks- Are attacks by flooding a sites/companies infrastructure in different ways. Usually it involves illegitimate users requesting information so that legitimate users cannot access their content. Ddos use botnets, because they require a lot of computing power, while DOS usually involves only one person using a script of some sort.
    VPN, a virtual private network, can be used for things like an employee accessing a company’s intranet, or to get around geo-restrictions and censorship. VPNs work by going through a series of dedicated connections (point to point, like a child’s tin can), virtual tunneling, or traffic encryption.
    Tunneling protocol- allows a user to access or provide a service. Works by having the data portion of a packet (payload) carry the packets that actually provide the service.
    Endpoint security - means that devices follow a definite level of compliance and standards.
    Layered Security - combining multiple security controls for protection. The idea is to slow down attackers, consuming time, until the security resources can be brought against the attacker. -->

    <!-- Ip addresses -->
    <!-- Network Address Translation - A method of remapping one IP address space into another, to hide a member or network.
    IP address spoofing- creation of IP packets with a false IP address in order to hide the identity of a sender, can be accomplished by using a proxy server.
    DHCP- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is way to designate IP addresses, interfaces, and services. It reduces the need for a network administrator. -->

    <!-- Load Balancing -->
    <!-- Load balancing seeks to maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload of a single resource. Load balancing is usually achieved through a multilayer switch or a Domain Name System(DNS). Divides traffic between network interfaces on a network socket. (OSI 4 or layer 7(HTTP)).
    Round robin- multiple IP addresses are associated with a single domain and clients are given ip for a limited time.
    DNS Delegation- Depending on where the domain comes from, the load balancer will ping the server, and send the traffic to the best server. Generally, this is going to be the server which is geographically closest, but in the case that it isn’t, a different server can serve up the information.
    Client side- The clients are given a list of ips, and the client selects which one they would like. It is argued this approach is better than round robin because of caching issues with the round robin approach. In the case a server is down, i
    Channel bonding implies a division of traffic between physical interfaces at a lower level. (OSI 2 or 3) Usually involves communication between networks and operating systems. -->


    <!--OSI  -->
    <!-- Multi-layer switch- a computer device that switches on different OSI layers.
    OSI- a computing model for transferring data. It is made up of 7 layers, including physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, application. -->

    <!-- Throughput  and latency-->
    <!-- The network throughput is the rate of successful message delivery over a communication channel.
    The system throughput- sum of the data rates that are delivered to all terminals.
    Throughput can be affected by the physical medium, processing power, and end-user behavior.
    Latency-  time delay between the cause and effect of some physical change. Latency can never be faster than the speed of light, because of physics.</p> -->

    <h2>How the Internet Works</h2>
    <h4>Your Computer</h4>
    <p>
      If you were in your house, but you needed to get a few things you
      would assign different tasks to your good for nothing housemates.
      So let's say you need to get eggs.
    </p>
      <p>You would give your daughter money, who would then give it to
        your wife (who you aren't fighting with....it's just you hate
        her face).
    </p>
     <p>Your wife, would give the money to your son, who would go buy eggs,
      and use the change to buy beer. He would give the eggs to his mother,
      who would give it to your daughter, and then you could throw the
      eggs at your wife's car.
      <br>
      <br>
      That is how the internet works!
    </p>

    <p>
      Your computer sends a signal down the TCP/IP protocol stack. The
      signal goes from an application (your daughter) to the IP (your wife),
      down to the hardware layer (your son). The hardware layer breaks
      messages into binary and, if the messages are too large, into
      packets. Before we talk about where the packets go, let's talk about
      how your computer deals with packets.
    </p>

    <p>
      When your computer recieves packets, the hardware layer converts
      them from binary. It organizes this information and sends it to the
      IP layer. The IP then sends the information to the application,
      which handles the readability for you.
    </p>

    <h4>NSPs and ISPs</h4>
    <p>
      In order to get the eggs, your son had to drive on roads. These
      roads may be owned by California, a private citizen, or whomever. And
      on his way he may have to take several different roads, made
      and owned by different people. This, in essence, is an NSP.
    </p>

    <p>
      NSPs (Network Service Providers) make up the backbone of the
      internet, which are required connect to Network Access Points (NAPs).
      When your packets reach an NAP, they may jump from one access point
      to another. Metropolitan Area Exchanges (MAEs), are like Network Access
      Points, but are privately owned. These two (NAPs and MAEs) make
      up Internet Exchange Points (IXs).
    </p>
    <p>
      NSPs sell bandwith to Internet Service Providers (ISPs). You
      have dealt with an ISP, as they are the ones who provide you
      access to the internet. So in essence, your ISP acts as a bully
      who stands outside your door, demanding a toll monthly so your son
      can buy eggs.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking for your Information</h4>
    <p>
      Now, let's say that your mom told your son to go to a specific
      market, like Safeway on the corner of 40th and Buena Vista. If
      your son didn't know how to get there, and he didn't have GPS, he
      may call a friend. If the friend didn't know, he could call someone
      else, until someone gave him directions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is how your computer finds your information. Your packets are
      sent to a router. The router looks to see if it knows where the
      IP address you are looking for is. If it does not, it asks another
      router, going up a chain, which will eventually stop at the NSP
      backbone.
    </p>

    <p>
      It gets slightly more complicated, since the name you use to find
      a website, and the one your computer is looking for is slightly
      different. You go to www.SadandUgly.com, but your computer looks for
      an IP address. The router your computer asks is called a Domain Name
      Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      SadandUgly.com is known as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL),
      but the IP address is a series of numbers, and in order to retreive
      that information, your computer has to ask the DNS where the site is
      located.
    </p>
    <p>
      A domain name service is a database (a list, if you want), which
      tracks different IP addresses. But, it cannot hold all of the IP
      addresses to the entire internet.
    </p>

    <h4>Other Pertinent Information</h4>
    <p> As you may, or may not know, there are many programming languages.
      Like English, Spanish, and other langauges, those languages
      have rules, which people choose to follow, or not. When your
      computer looks for a website, it requests this in HTTP protocol,
      which is not to be confused with HTML.
    </p>
    <p> HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language, which is how programmers
      present information on a webpage. HTTP is a protocol which
      determines how computers communicate over the world wide web, WWW.
      When you type a url into a page, you ping a DNS server, retrieves
      the data, and your computer parses it.
    </p>

    <h4>Putting it all together</h4>
    <p> When your computer gets information from a website, it goes
      down the TCP/IP stack, which sends packets through your ISPs
      routers. It goes through these routers, using the DNS, until
      it finds a web server. The web server responds with some HTTP,
      and your computer goes back up the TCP/IP stack to serve you the
      information. If that doesn't make sense, go back and re-read this
      page.
    </p>

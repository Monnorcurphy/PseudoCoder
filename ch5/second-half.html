  <!--Client Side vs Server Side rendering, needs more research  -->
  Client side v.s. server side rendering
  Server side is preferable due to being visible to search engines, pages load faster, and maintains pages as documents. Server side is faster initially, but slower on subsequent page loads  Client side is good because you don’t need to request the whole web page, and allows only portions of the webpage to be updated.

  <!-- UI vs UX -->
  UI is User Interface while UX is User experience. UI is the skin, the presentation. UX is the organs, measuring and optimizing input.
  UX existed before the digital space, known as market research. UX designers often analyze competitors, customers, strategies, and content. UX designers need to do marketing, designing, and project management.
  UI the means by which the user and computer system interact. UI designers do customer analysis, design, and branding. User interface is the process of visually guiding the user through the product’s interface.
   

  <!--Databases  -->
  Computer cluster consists of a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that they can be viewed as a single system. Computer clusters have each node perform the same tasks, controlled and scheduled by the software.
  NoSQL database are commonly used in big data and real-time web applications. They have a simple design, simpler horizontal scaling to clusters (this is a problem for relational databases), have finer control over availability. The data structures used by NoSQL are more flexible than relational database tables.
  NoSQL has not been adopted because there is an inability to perform ad-hoc joins across tables, lack of standardized interfaces, and investments in relational databases. NoSQL offers “eventual consistency” which might result in stale reads, along with some data loss.

  <!--Scaling  -->
  Scaling out vs scaling up
  Multi-core concurrency is referred to as Scale up, and distributed computing is referred to as scale out.
  Scaling up is the process of making a computer more and more workload, while scaling out is getting more computers to handle the problem.   Scaling up is cheaper, but is more risky.

  <!-- Database types -->
  SQL, NoSQL, and serverless:
  Sql is a relational database

    <h2>System Design</h2>
    <h4>What does it mean to design a system?</h4>
    <p>When you build a website, or start a company you need to design
      your system. System design is the the creation, defining, and
      development of systems in order to satisfy user requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Software is standardized which means systems can now be modular,
      and this increases the importance of software engineering. Unified
      Modeling Language (UML) is the standard language which is supposed
      to provide a way to visualize the design of a system. The idea of
      UML is to blueprint elements such as activities (jobs), components
      of the system (how they interact with software components), how
      the system will run, how components and interfaces interact, and
      external user interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      UML designs have static (structural) views which emphasize the
      static structure of the system using objects, attributers,
      operations, and relationships. Including class diagrams and
      composite structure diagrams. For example a component diagram
      describes how a software system is split up into components and
      shows the dependencies amongst these components.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also has dynamic (behavioral) view which emphasizes the dynamic
      behavior of the system through displaying the internal states of
      objects. This is used to describe how software/ideas are supposed
      to function and interact with each other. Logical design pertains
      to the abstract idea of how the data flows, inputs/outputs to the
      system, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physical design describes how data is actually
      input into the system, and is usually broken down into user
      interface, data design, and process design.   User interface design
      is concerned with how users add information to the system, and
      how it presents that information back to them. Data design is
      concerned with how the data is represented and stored within the
      system. Process design is concerned with how data moves through the
      system, how/where it is validated, etc.

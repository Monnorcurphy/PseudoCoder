            <h2 >How to use this Resource</h2>
            <h4>For Newbies</h4>
              <p class= 'information noob'>
              It is meant to be a resource for new programmers to be able to
              learn everything from efficiency (Big Omega, Theta, etc.),
              to bit manipulation, to firewalls, and everything in between.
              I have found that there are a lot of resources out there, including
              Gayle McDowell's wonderful resource (Cracking the Coding Interview), youtube
              videos, and even wikipedia. I have found, that I am often going through article
              after article, using youtube, and searching, which can be obnoxious. I wanted to
              make something that was easy to understand, so you can get a basic idea of how it
              all works from the get go, and then you can move up the chain of complexity.
              I will explain it simply, and then point at more advanced places where you can
              learn more.
            </p>

            <h4>For the Experienced</h4>
              <p class= 'information experienced'>
            	For those who have experience in the field but need to brush up.
              I will have coding tests, along with knowledge checks added
							to the summary section of every chapter. If you know everything
							and can code it all up, chances are you know everything I covered.
							When you have done chapter 1-4, feel free to move onto chapter 5.
							It is fairly advanced, covering topics of all shapes and sizes.
							If you can get through all of that, feel free to check out my
							blog, where I will be covering more advanced topics weekly in
							the same manner as this site.
            </p>

            <h4>For both</h4>
              <p class= 'information fun'>
                Through my explanations I want to make it simple, easy, and fun. Maybe
                you need to understand threading with processes, and how they work together,
                or you just need some way to remember which sorting algorithim is which.
                I will explain it, likely with an outrageous example, that makes the work
                simple to visualize. I also hope that in writing this I have managed to be
                funny. The color in the design, and in the langauge, is to make this less boring.
                Textbooks are great, if you are a professor, but if you are a student, you
                probably want something that makes you laugh while you learn,
                I hope to be that for you.
            </p>

            <h2 >Reporting Problems</h2>
            <p class= 'information wrongness'>
              I will often try to explain things in a fun and easy way, which means I may
              make something unclear, or outright wrong. If you see a mistake, PLEASE, tell me.
              I will do my best to research everything, but guess what, imma human. So imma
              make mistakes. Since this resource is supposed to be educational, every second
              a mistake exists is awful, since I taught someone incorrectly. I will do my best
              to make sure that does not happen. Since that may not always work out, I want
              to make sure that people can tell me I was wrong. I appreciate anyone who corrects
              me, on either clarity or an error I make.

            <h2 >How to use this Resource</h2>
              <p class= 'information noob'>
              PseudoCoder is a resource for new programmers to learn and
							practice bit manipulation, firewalls, efficiency, and
							everything in between. But to be honest, everyone could
							afford to learn from my awesomeness. There are a lot of
							great resources out there, including Gayle McDowell's book
							Cracking the Coding Interview, tons of youtube videos, and
							even wikipedia, if you're desperate. I made something
							that surpasses them all. It is easy to understand that
							offers a basic idea of how computers, for you neanderthals.
            </p>

              <p class= 'information experienced'>
            	For those who have experience in the field but need to
							brush up, why didn't you do a better job of keeping your
							skills sharp? I have knowledge checks at the end of most
							sections, or for the supremely lazy, I have everything
							in the summary chapter. For those of you who aren't
							totally worthless, I will be writing a blog every week
							covering more advanced topics. These blog posts will also
							have knowledge checks so you can prove your worthlessness.
            </p>
              <p class= 'information fun'>
                This resource is supposed to be fun, and easy to read.
								If it isn't, then you did something wrong. First you
								ruined your parents marriage, and now this site. Is there
								anything you can't mess up?

            <h2>Reporting Problems and Who I am</h2>
            <p class= 'information wrongness'>
              In the highly unlikely event that I made a mistake, and in
							the even more unusual circumstance that you noticed it,
							feel free to contact me so I can fix it. I don't want to
							misinform the peons who read this site, since they are
							already dumb enough.

					<p>I am a highly skilled, very capable programmer, who is
						often to busy to deal with all of the problems put across
						my desk. More often than not, some idiot has messed up
						my computer, so I have to spend hours dealing with that.
						Sometimes, my enemies mess with my code when I am not looking
						in order to further hinder my process. I don't often see
						them, or know who they are, but I know that I could never
						make those mistakes. If you don't listen to me, you are an
						idiot.

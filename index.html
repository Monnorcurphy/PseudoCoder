            <h2 >How to use this Resource</h2>
            <h4>For Newbies</h4>
              <p class= 'information noob'>
              First, it is meant to be a resource for new programmers to be able to
              learn everything from efficiency (Big Omega, Theta, etc.),
              to bit manipulation, to firewalls, and everything in between.
              I have found that there are a lot of resources out there, including
              Gayle McDowell's wonderful resource (Cracking the Coding Interview), youtube
              videos, and even wikipedia. I have found, that I am often going through article
              after article, using youtube, and searching, which can be obnoxious. I wanted to
              make something that was easy to understand, so you can get a basic idea of how it
              all works from the get go, and then you can move up the chain of complexity.
              I will explain it simply, and then point at more advanced places where you can
              learn more.
            </p>

            <h4>For the Experienced</h4>
              <p class= 'information experienced'>
              Second, for those who have experience in the field but need to brush up.
              I will cover the basics in succinct sentences so you don't need to comb
              through all the shit.  My gaols it to make this resource easy
              for my experienced coders. Maybe you have an interview coming up
              and you don't want to go through All of CTCI, I understand that. The goal
              is to cover the basics, and give you some ways to work the rust out for
              your upcoming interviews.
            </p>

            <h4>For both</h4>
              <p class= 'information fun'>
                Through my explanations I want to make it simple, easy, and fun. Maybe
                you need to understand threading, processes, and how they work together,
                or you just need some way to remember which sorting algorithim is which.
                I will explain it, likely with an outrageous example, that makes the work
                simple to visualize. I also hope that in writing this I have managed to be
                funny. The color in the design, and in the langauge, is to make this less boring.
                Textbooks are great, if you are a professor, but if you are a student, you
                probably want something that makes you laugh while you learn,
                I hope to be that for you.
            </p>

            <h2 >Reporting Problems</h2>
            <p class= 'information wrongness'>
              I will often try to explain things in a fun and easy way, which means I may
              make something unclear, or outright wrong. If you see a mistake, PLEASE, tell me.
              I will do my best to research everything, but guess what, imma human. So imma
              make mistakes. Since this resource is supposed to be educational, every second
              a mistake exists is awful, since I taught someone incorrectly. I will do my best
              to make sure that does not happen. Since that may not always work out, I want
              to make sure that people can tell me I was wrong. I appreciate anyone who corrects
              me, on either clarity or an error I make.

area of a polygon

Formula to find the area with points A, B, and C (letâ€™s assume C is the origin):

(X coordinate of A * Y coordinate of B - Y coordinate of A * X coordinate of B)
/2

Make sure you take the absolute value, since it can be negative in certain cases




going through a graph


You can go through a graph in pre, in, or post order. What does that mean?

For pre order, you go from the root, to the left node, to the right node.

For in order you go from the left, to the root, to the right node.

For post order you go from the left, to the right, to the root.

All three of these traversal methods are DFS (Depth First Search)

You don't need to memoize when you are going through a tree because there is only
one path to any given node. If there is more than one path to a node, that means
there is a cycle, and it is therefore a graph.


DFS should be written recursively, BFS should be written iteratively.

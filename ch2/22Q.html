    <h2>Chapter 2.2 Questions</h2>

    <h4>Before we start building</h4>
    <p> If you don't know how to program, then I don't know what you are
    doing here. Go learn a language. I recommend Python or Ruby. I will
    be solving all of the problems I run by you in Python. If you want
    to learn something else, go here and type in "Learn" and your
    language:
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href='https://www.google.com/' target='_blank'>The best programming resource</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    Here are some resources for Python:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href= 'https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python' target= '_blank'>Codecademy</a></li>
      <li><a href= 'https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/' target= '_blank'>Learn Python the Hard Way</a></li>
      <li><a href= 'http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/' target= '_blank'>Hitchhikers Guide to Python</a></li>
      <li><a href= 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mEzFDjqtA' target= '_blank'>Learn Python in 1 video</a></li>
      <li><a href= 'https://www.google.com' target= '_blank'>Type in 'Python Resources'</a></li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Static arrays</h4>
    <p>
      A static array means that it can only hold a certain number of
      items. A dynamic array resizes automatically. Your first task is
      to build a static array. You can use your languages built in
      methods. Build a dynamic array class, where you can:
      <ul>
        <li>Pop- take an element off the end</li>
        <li>Push- add an element on at the end</li>
        <li>View- see an element at an index in the array</li>
      </ul>

    </p>

    <p>Think about how you are going to deal with pushing when the array
      is full, popping when the array is empty, viewing when the array
      is empty/the index is out of range.
    </p>

    <h4>Dynamic arrays</h4>
    <p>
      A dynamic array means that it can only any number items. A dynamic
      array resizes automatically. But to make it more challenging, you
      should build your dynamic array on top of your static array. It
      should still be able to pop, push, and view.
    </p>

    <h4>Queue</h4>
    <p>
      A queue is a dynamic array, where you can only pop off the front,
      view the item in front, and add to the back. AS YOU SHOULD KNOW.
      Build a queue. It should have pop, view (you can also call it
      peek), and push. But it should follow queue rules.
    </p>

    <h4>Stack</h4>
    <p>
      A stack is a dynamic array, where you can only pop off the front,
      view the item in front, and add to the front....you get it.
      Build a stack. It should have the same funcations as a queue.
    </p>

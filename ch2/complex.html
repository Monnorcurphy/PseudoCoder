      <h2>Complex Structures</h2>
      <h4>Caches</h4>
      <p>
        A cache is like a jewelry box. A jewelry box, is small, and
        generally holds the most valuable things in your possession, so
        in my case it holds an excessive amount of seeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you had a very large closet, and you were looking for a
        specific piece of jewelry, it would take a long time. You would
        have to walk deep into the caverns of your closet. Then you
        would all the way back out, and then walk all the way back to
        get it again every time you wore it. That’s dumb. But you "aren’t
        stupid", so you put all the most used pieces into your jewelry
        box.
      </p>
      <p>Now, jewelry boxes are not infinite, so you can only store a
        few pieces in there. That is a cache! Now the method for jewelry
        that we talked about is more specifically the idea for the LRU
        cache. That is least recently used.   There are MANY other ways to
        handle a cache, and a jewelry box, and I don’t want to get too
        mired down by them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This example is just like RAM and hard disk storage in computing.
        RAM is much faster than hard disk storage. Caches work with RAM
        to allow users access to data that is used frequently, or
        whichever caching scheme is deemed appropriate.
      </p>

      <h4>Hash Collisions</h4>
      <p>
        As you know from the terminology section, hashing is the method
        by which data is partitioned into sections of a hash. Each
        section of a hash is like a box. So, when you have you put
        something into a hashing function, it picks a box, and places it
        there. What if, two things are assigned to the same box? Well,
        luckily we have a data structure that can help us out, linked
        lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        The box is turned into a linked list, however this comes at a
        price, access. We can no longer guarantee that we will be able
        to access the values at a given key in constant time, since a
        linked list could be N elements long. This is why most hashes
        say that when a hash/dictionary becomes too packed, we must
        resize. This can happen when a box stores more than a certain
        number of items. It can also happen when a hash stores more
        items than originally anticipated. It resizes itself (maybe it
        had 10 boxes before, now it has 20), and assigns the values in
        the boxes to the appropriate locations.
      </p>

      <h4>Heaps</h4>
      <p>
        Heaps do not easily lend themselves to explanations, but luckily
        I am a boss and can explain anything through analogies. Heaps,
        are like boarding groups for flights. Flights usually have
        a first class, a business class, and a coach section.
      </p>
      <p>
        If an airline boarded the first class first, then business,
        then coach, but no one was in business class, what happens? You
        just board coach next. This is exactly like a min heap. Or max
        heap, depending on how you feel about people who sit in first
        class.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two types of heaps, a min heap, and a max heap. In a
        min heap the lowest value is on top. Let's say its 1. The values
        below 1 are greater than 1, and less than the numbers beneath
        them. Heaps are great for finding the minimum, or maximum, in
        a group of numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't understand, have a toddler read this page and then
        explain it to you. A heap is a pile of numbers, you can think of
        them as nodes. The top node points to a value, in a min heap that
        is the lowest value. In a max heap, that is the highest value.
        When you take the top node off of the heap, you replace it with
        the next value. A heap's head node looks at all the children,
        finds the lowest value, and makes that the new head. Simple.
      </p>

      <p>Like this:
        <br>
        <br>
        2
        <br>
        4 3
        <br>
        6 5
        <br>
        <br>
        We take two off, and replace the values
        <br>
        <br>
        3
        <br>
        4 5
        <br>
        6
        <br>
        <br>
        Three keeps 5 as its child, and reassigns 4 to be another child.
        4 does not move, and if 5 had children, they would be moved up.
        If we popped three off, 4 would become the new head, moving 6 up,
        and 4 would have 5 as its new child.
      </p>

  <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <h4>Abstract Data Type v.s. Data Structure</h4>
  <p>An abstract data type is an idea, a data structure the building
  that idea. If you have plans for a building, you can talk about how
  that building will have a certain number of bathrooms, how tall each
  floor will be, what it will be made out of. You can guarentee, in theory
  that the building will be able to perform different functions with a
  certain amoutn of efficiency. This is an abstract data type.
</p>
  <p>
    In reality, the building gets built out of wood, there is only 1
    bathroom in a 6 story building, and all of the businesses go under
    in the first year. That is a data structure. It is possible for a
    data structure to accomplish tasks in similar run times to an
    abstract data type, but you have to know what you are doing, and we
    have established, that is never going to happen.
  </p>
  <h4>Hashing</h4>
  <p>
    If I wanted to give you some stuff, but I wanted each thing to be
  stored in its own, individual box, how would you do it? For a small
  enough number of things, you could just label each box, 1..2..3..etc.
  But what if I wanted you to be able to quickly find whatever was in
  each box? Well, then you would need to find a way to input the name,
  description, or some other characteristic of the item, and assign it
  to a box. This is what a hashing function does.
</p>
<p>
  It takes input, and runs it through an equation, assigning the unique
  value that is given to a box. For a more indepth idea of how this works
  read the "Hash Functions" source below. The idea basically is that if
  you put in "Hello" and "Help" two different values would come out, and
  these values would then be mapped to a specific box, making it easy to
  find these values again. Sometimes, values may get mapped to the same
  box which is called a collision. I will cover more on that later.
</p>
  <h4>Nodes</h4>
  <p>
    A node is like an egg. It contains some data, and it is self
    contained. Generally, nodes are used when we talk about graphs and
    linked lists. Nodes can have children, parents, or edges. If a
    node has no parent, it is generally called the root (in a tree), or
    the head (in a linked list, or a tree, depending). If a node has no
    children it is called a leaf (in a tree), or the tail (in a linked
    list). We will discuss more about trees (which are types of graphs),
    and linked lists in this chapter.
  </p>
  <h4>Cycles</h4>
  <p>
    A graph is a series of connected nodes. Nodes can be connected in
    many ways. Cycles are relevant to this, because it can tell us if
    we are dealing with a graph, or a tree. A graph with a cycle, is not
    a tree. Let me repeat that, IF A GRAPH HAS A CYCLE IT IS NOT A TREE.
    That is important to remember, and very easy. So remember it.
  </p>
  <p>
    A cycle looks like this. I have a friend, Janice, Janice has a friend
    Tommy, Tommy has a friend, me. That is a cycle. If Tommy was not
    friends with me, then the only way for you to get from Tommy to me
    would be to go through Janice. Detecting cycles is a common question
    in programming interviews, so it is good to know about.

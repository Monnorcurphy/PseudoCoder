      <h2>Data Structures</h2>
      <p>You come to me today, not knowing anything about the real world
        of programming. Well, the real, theoretical world of real programming.
        The theoretically real world of theoretical programming? Shit.
        Hold up.
        <br>
        <br>
        You come to me today, not know anything about the world of...
        THE POINT IS. You are dumb, and you need to know more about data
        stuructures and how to program stuff. I will be covering all of
        the basic data structures you will need to know, plus some
        more advanced ones. You will absolutely need everything up to
        medium, complex is debatable. But don't be lazy, you peice of
        alien garbage. (I don't know if you qualify for "human")
      </p>

      <h2>A Look Ahead</h2>
      <h4>Terminology</h4>
      <p>Hashing, etc. etc. put stuff here. Connor is great.</p>
      <h4>Simple Structures</h4>
      <p>I will be covering queues, stacks, and arrays. These are the
      most basic data structures that programmers deal with, so if you
      struggle with them, it should say something about your career
      choices. I hear plumbers make good money.</p>
      <h4>Medium Structures</h4>
      <p>Hashes (also called dictionaries), Linked Lists, and graphs.
      This section will be our first abstract section, with difficult to
      understand concepts. So wish me good luck in explaining it to you.
      </p>
      <h4>Complex Structures</h4>
      <p>Caches, and heaps. Heaps are talked about as often as people
        talk about the positive attributes of horses. Caches, are slightly
        more useful than heaps, and much more useful than horses.

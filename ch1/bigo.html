  <h2>What is Big O</h2>
    <h4>Intro Example</h4>
    <p>I am a big fan of analogies because they make it easy for smart
      people to explain complex things to….well, people like you!
      You are so smart, who’s a little smarty? It’s you! It’s you!
    </p>
    <p>
      Alright, let’s say you have to solve a problem, like washing the
      dishes, and you have 3 workers. Each worker will be so efficient
      at a task, I won’t get too mired down with the details since
      it would be too confusing for your tiny…uh, never mind.
    </p>

    <p>When you assign these workers, there is a best way, an average
      way, and a worst way. And you cannot always control how that turns
      out. Like worker one’s sippie cup might have spilled, and now he
      won’t agree to dry the dishes. You can try to force him, but he
      unionize with the other works, or worse….tell his mother.
      *Shudder*   So you have to deal with that and assign him to a
      different task. This situation is exactly like Big O, Theta, and
      Omega. It is a way to tell people, in the best conditions this is
      how efficiently I am solving this problem, in the average case,
      this is how efficient, and in the worst case this is the case.
      So which is which?
    </p>
    <h2>Which is which?</h2>
    <h4>Big O- The workers revolt</h4>
    <p>Big O is the worst case scenario, all of your most efficient
      workers have decided that they will not do the job that is best
      suited to them. Instead, they want to do the job they are the worst
      at. It’s like a clown trying to be funny, or my wife trying to love
      me, just not a good fit.
    </p>
    <p>How does this apply to the real world? And by real world I mean
      digital world of computer programming. Let’s say you have to sort a
      list of items. In the worst case, the items would be sorted, but in
      reverse order. The exact WORST possible situation. So, that is where
      Big O lives. Big O says, everything has gone wrong. Everything is
      terrible. No one wants this, but we still have to solve this problem.
      How efficient are you now. The lower your Big O, the more impressive
      it is.
    </p>
    <h4>Big Omega- The workers are happy</h4>
    <p>Big Omega is the case where all workers are happy, and they do the
      perfect job for them. Instead of everything going wrong, everything
      is going perfectly, and nothing bad can touch you here. It’s a lot
      like kids in college,  idealistic and perfect.  This is if you have
      to sort a list, and it is already sorted. HOORAY! On the flip side,
      the worse your Big Omega is, the more unimpressive it is.
    </p>
    <p>Time to pause to experience the irony. Big O is all about the
      worst possible case, everything is terrible, and yet it is the best
      place to impress someone. While Big Omega is all about the best case,
      everything is great, and it is the easiest way to show someone you
      are a big moron. Just something interesting to ponder, if you don’t
      see the irony, don’t worry. It’s because your big brain is too big
      to comprehend it. Who’s a good reader? It’s still you! It’s still you!
    </p>
    <h4>Big Theta- The Workers Have Unionized</h4>
    <p>Let’s say that you have your three workers, and they decide that
      they always want to accomplish the task in the relative amount of time.
      They always want to finish the job in an hour. So, even if Brian spills
      his sippie cup, or Joan falls down the stairs.... again. They will guarantee
      that the job will always be finished in an hour. This could look different
      and happen in many ways, but it’s not important. The concept is the
      important part.
    </p>
    <p>If you can solve a problem and your Big O and Big Omega are the same,
      then you have a Big Theta. Not all problems have a Big Theta, since
      sometimes in the best case you will be able to solve a problem quickly,
      while the worst case will take much longer.  These concepts are basic,
      but they are important for you to move forward. In life no one cares
      about the best case, because we aren’t college kids. We live in the real
      world. And if you can solve problems under the worst conditions,
      then we know how much you are worth.

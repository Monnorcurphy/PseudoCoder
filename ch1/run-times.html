<h2>Different run times</h2>
  <h4>Factorial - Death is your only saving grace</h4>
  <h5>The notation: O(n!)</h5>
  <h5>What it means: Literally the worst time you can get</h5>
  <h5>Where Will You See It:</h5>
  <p>If you were a panhandler and needed to get money from as many people
    as possible, but you did not want to waste your time. Let’s say you
    are low on food, and you need to use every calorie as efficiently
    as possible. So, you are going to 3 houses, how do you find the most
    efficient route.   You calculate the distance from house 1 to 2, then 2 to 3.
    THEN you calculate the distance from house 2 to 1, then 1 to 3. Then you
    calculate the distance from 2 to 3, then 3 to 1. And so on. This is a
    version of the Traveling Salesman problem. It is part of a special series
    of problems, which we will touch on later. 

  </p>
  <p>If you need to calculate “all possible” or “everything”…pretty much if
    someone is like “Hey, there’s a ton of stuff in this thing we got, and
    we need to know what the best way to get through all of it, including between
    them.” It is probably in this class of problems. Specifically, if someone
    asks for all permutations, it’s Factorial.
  </p>

  <h4>Exponential - Sell the house, invest in seeds</h4>
  <h5>The notation: O(2 ^ N)</h5>
  <h5>What it means: This problem sucks, but at least it’s not factorial.</h5>
  <h5>Where Will You See It:</h5>
  <p>The above example is still a good way to demonstrate this class.
    Let’s say that you figure out there are certain routes which are
    efficient, and there is no way to beat them. Like if the house 1 and
    house 2 were right next to each other, so regardless of all other
    situations, you should travel to those houses one after another
    (be it 1 then 2, or 2 then 1). In this instance, you don’t need to
    compute every iteration. You will often see these types of solutions
    used in dynamic programming to solve factorial problems.
  </p>


  <h4>Polynomial - Buy a bunker, and start filling it with canned peaches</h4>
  <h5>The notation: O(N^2)</h5>
  <h5>What it means: This problem sucks, it is going to be expensive to solve</h5>
  <h5>Where Will You See It:</h5>
  <p>What if you wanted to be a matchmaker, but you were really bad
  at it...like you are at.....well, just remember what your mom always
  told you as a kid. If you had 4 people, and you wanted to make everyone
  happy, they would all go on a date. Person A with B, A with C, and A with
  D. Then B with C, B with D, C with D. And you are done! This is different
  from Factorial, because person A matches with B, which means B does
  not have to match with A, they have already gone on a date!</p>


  <h4>Linearithmic - Leave grandma and get in the van</h4>
  <h5>The notation: O(N lg N)</h5>
  <h5>What it means: So.... you are sorting something?</h5>
  <h5>Where Will You See It:</h5>
  <p>Sorting. Just memorize that, if you can. If you can't, quit programming.
  Not all sorting algorithms sort that quickly, but the absolute best ones
  sort that quickly. Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc. It is slightly worse
  than O(N), but if you need to go through a bunch of things and you cannot
  get better time than O(N^2), then sort it. I will touch on this subject
  later, when we talk about...sorting. Kind of obvious, but you never know.</p>


  <h4>Linear - I guess we can keep the kids, for now. </h4>
  <h5>The notation: O(N)</h5>
  <h5>What it means: You only need to look at everything once</h5>
  <h5>Where Will You See It:</h5>
  <p>So, God help us, I am going to have explain an abstact concept to you.
  You can get O(N) in time complexity if you have to go throught the
  elements only once. However, it can also happen if you have to go through
  the same elements over and over again. I.e. If you have an array
  [1,2,3,4, 1]. You go through, and delete duplicates one at a time.
  First you would delete the 1 at the end, but then you have to go through
  and check it one more time. In this case, you are doing two passes of
  the array, but that is 2N, and in Big O we do not care about integer
  values. So, your time is reduced down to O(N)</p>

  <h4>Logarithmic - Let's take that vacation after all</h4>
  <h5>The notation: O(lg n) </h5>
  <h5>What it means: Someone else did some work, and now you profit from it.</h5>
  <h5>Where Will You See It:</h5>
  <p>Congrats, you are doing Binary Search. I am so proud of you. Or you
  are working with a certain graphs. This means that you only need to look at half
  of the data you are given. Probably because you are looking for a number
  or name in a sorted list of numbers/names. If someone says the word sorted,
  think "can I use binary search?" It won't always work, but sometimes it will.
  Also, this will come up in reference to Binary Search Trees, AVL trees, and
  Red and Black trees. You will learn more about these subjects later.</p>


  <h4>Constant - Buy lottery tickets, quit your job, and relax </h4>
  <h5>The notation: O(N)</h5>
  <h5>What it means: Solving this problem is unimportant</h5>
  <h5>Where Will You See It:</h5>
  <p>Does the answer exist somewhere in a dictionary/hash? In terms of solving
  a problem, it is not going to be frequent that you will be expected to solve
  something with constant time. It might be possible to use constant space, which is
  an important part of Big O, so don't forget to analyze your space complexity.</p>

<h2>Different run times</h2>
  <h4>Factorial - Death is your ownly saving grace</h4>
  <h5>The notation: O(n!)</h5>
  <h5>What it means: Literally the worst time you can get</h5>
  <h5>Where Will You See It:</h5>
  <p>If you were a panhandler and needed to get money from as many people
    as possible, but you did not want to waste your time. Let’s say you
    are low on food, and you need to use every calorie as efficiently
    as possible. So, you are going to 3 houses, how do you find the most
    efficient route.  You calculate the distance from house 1 to 2, then 2 to 3.
    THEN you calculate the distance from house 2 to 1, then 1 to 3. Then you
    calculate the distance from 2 to 3, then 3 to 1. And so on. This is a
    version of the Traveling Salesman problem. It is part of a special series
    of problems, which we will touch on later. 

  </p>
  <p>If you need to calculate “all possible” or “everything”…pretty much if
    someone is like “Hey, there’s a ton of stuff in this thing we got, and
    we need to know what the best way to get through all of it, including between
    them.” It is probably in this class of problems. Specifically, if someone
    asks for all permutations, it’s Factorial.
  </p>

  <h4>Exponential - Sell the house, invest in seeds</h4>
  <h5>The notation O(2 ^ N)</h5>
  <h5>What it means: This problem sucks, but at least it’s not factorial.</h5>
  <h5>Where Will You See It:</h5>
  <p>The above example is still a good way to demonstrate this class.
    Let’s say that you figure out there are certain routes which are
    efficient, and there is no way to beat them. Like if the house 1 and
    house 2 were right next to each other, so regardless of all other
    situations, you should travel to those houses one after another
    (be it 1 then 2, or 2 then 1). In this instance, you don’t need to
    compute every iteration. You will often see these types of solutions
    used in dynamic programming to solve factorial problems.

  <h4>Polynomial - Buy a bunker, and start filling it with canned peaches</h4>
  <h5>The notation O(N^2)</h5>
  <h5>What it means- This problem sucks, it is going to be expensive to solve</h5>
  <h5>Where Will You See It:</h5>
  <p>When you multiply two numbers, like 37 * 48, you probably do it this
    way. 8 * 7, 8* 3, 4* 7, 4 * 3. That is a perfect example, for every
    number in 37, you are doing some work on it with every number in 48.
    If you had to go through two things and you needed to use stuff from
    both source 1 and source 2, then you are likely dealing with N squared.
    Generally, you will see this when you first start solving problems.
    They can usually be improved upon, since they are brute force solutions,
    that is not always true however.</p>

  <h4>Linearithmic - Buy health insurance, soonish</h4>
  <h5>The notation O(N lg N): Leave grandma and get in the van</h5>

  <h4>Linear - </h4>
  <h5>The notation O(N): I guess we can keep the kids, for now.</h5>

  <h4>Logarthmic - </h4>
  <h5>The notation O(lg n): Let's take that vacation after all</h5>

  <h2>Efficiency</h2>
  <p>You might be here because you are trying to become a programmer,
    trying to improve yourself as a programmer, or you have a programming
    interview tomorrow and you are totally screwed.   Regardless of any of this,
    you can see the common theme in the stories above. That is, you are a
    piece of trash. Seriously.
    <br>
    <br>
    Think about what you did...
  </p>
  <p>
    Thankfully, I am here to set you down the right road.
    I will take accolades, money, or job offers. I know, I know,
    I am too good to you. What can I say, I am a giver.   The first thing you
    should know before you know how to program a line of code should be the
    things on this page. It will come with a grain of pepper. That grain is,
    you should not try to optimize too early. You are going to write
    inefficient programs, likely for the rest of your short career. But,
    if you try to make something perfect before you write it, you are never
    going to build anything, or anything worth while.
  </p>

  <h2>A Look Ahead</h2>
    <h4>Big O</h4>
    <p>An analysis of how programmers measure the efficiency of their programs.
       New programmers often play code golf, solving problems in as few lines
       as possible. This is incorrect, it can intefere with readability, which
       is a highly important factor. While readability is good, when it comes
       to truly measuring your program, determining how long it will it
       take to execute a task is the most important feature.
    </p>
    <h4>Terminology</h4>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h4>Run times</h4>
    <p> Learning the basic forumlas for how long a task takes, and how to
      determine how long a task will take, when it does not fit into the
      cookie cutter pattern I have laid out.
    </p>
    <h4>NP Complete</h4>
    <p> A complicated class of problems. Super math.

  <h2>Efficiency</h2>
  <p>You might be here because you are trying to become a programmer,
    trying to improve yourself as a programmer, or you have a programming
    interview tomorrow and you are totally screwed.   Regardless of any of this,
    you can see the common theme in the stories above. That is, you are a
    piece of trash. Seriously.
    <br>
    <br>
    Think about what you did...
  </p>
  <p>
    Thankfully, I am here to set you down the right road.
    I will take accolades, money, or job offers. I know, I know,
    I am too good to you. What can I say, I am a giver.   The first thing you
    should know before you know how to program a line of code should be the
    things on this page. It will come with a grain of pepper. That grain is,
    you should not try to optimize too early. You are going to write
    inefficient programs, likely for the rest of your phenomonenally short career.
    But, if you try to make something perfect before you write it, you are never
    going to build anything, or anything worth while.
  </p>

  <h2>A Look Ahead</h2>
    <h4>Terminology</h4>
    <p>For the future, this section will cover general basic topics. If
      you have experience, let's say you know what Big O is, then good for
      you! You can skip it, probably. Though, judging from the resources
      out there, you may want to look over it anyway, since my explanation
      is going to change the world of programming forever.
    </p>
    <p>I will cover what n is, and some basic math, since I know that not
      everyone can be expected to know all of this, and even if you know
      it, you have never heard anyone like me explain it to you.
    </p>
    <h4>Big O</h4>
    <p>An analysis of how programmers measure the efficiency of their programs.
       New programmers often play code golf, solving problems in as few lines
       as possible. This is incorrect, it can intefere with readability, which
       is a highly important factor. While readability is good, when it comes
       to truly measuring your program, determining how long it will it
       take to execute a task is the most important feature. A company
       does not care how short your solutions are, they care how much of
       their resources you are going to require.
    </p>

    <h4>Run times</h4>
    <p> Learning the basic forumlas for how long a task takes, and how to
      determine how long a task will take, when it does not fit into the
      cookie cutter pattern I have laid out.
    </p>
    <h4>NP Complete and Dynamic Programming</h4>
    <p> A complicated class of problems. It is important to know about
      if you are planning on working for any company that is doing
      anything worth while. If you don't care about the NP complete problems
      you probably care about dynamic programming which is a way of solving
      problems which are complicated.

<h2>NP & Dynamic Programming</h2>
  <h4>NP Complete</h4>
  <p>Think of any problem you like, it could be adding two numbers together
    or determining the number of your friends that will show up to your
    birthday party. I am sure it'll be different than last year. You
    just had bad timing, since your birthday fell in the middle of a spring
    break trip, and they just forgot to invite you. Not a big deal.
  </p>

  <p>Any problem you can think of is in a class of problems. Likely,
    you picked a problem in the P realm, which is to say a computer
    can solve it relatively quickly. Addition, for example, falls into
    this category. You can even think of something that a human, like
    what your mother and father, your siblings, your friends, pretty much
    anyone you know, barring yourself, can do quickly. If you had to find
    someone who was older than you, you could likely do this fairly quickly.
    Finding someone who weighed more than you, someone who was ugli...well.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are a set of problems which a computer cannot
    solve quickly, but they can quickly check the answer. Sudoku, is a
    great example of an NP problem. A computer can solve a sudoku puzzle
    in a 9X9 grid, relatively quickly, but the time becomes much
    worse as the grid becomes larger. Now, if a problem cannot be solved
    by a computer quickly, then we cannot check an answer quickly right?
  </p>

  <p> Wrong! As per usual. Given an incorrect solution to Sudoku, a
  computer can check it very quickly. Unfortunately, my Sudoku checker is
  not currently working. I think it has to do with the processor, since
  I know the code is right, and there is no way I did not correctly solve
  the puzzle, it was in a children's book. And I am part of MENSA, so...</p>


  <p>Not all NP problems have answers which can be checked relatively
  quickly. If an answer takes a long time to compute, then the problem
  is considered NP Hard. The interesting thing about solving an NP problem
  is that once you quickly solve one of them, the whole class of NP
  problems will be easy to solve. This is sigificant because things like
  protein folding are NP problems, and solving that would help us cure
  cancer. I was thinking about working on it, but I decided that my
  time would be better spent helping you. See what you did? All because
  you want to be a programmer....</p>

    This video is a longer, less interesting version of what I just explained:

  <h4>Dynamic Programming</h4>

  <p>If you had to mutliply big numbers together, how would you do it?
  You would probably multiply portions of the numbers together, then other
  portions, and then add all of your results together. So, let's do this.
  Let's multiply really big numbers together. How about 34, and 34. I
  know you are scared! But we can do this. I mean, I can. And you can watch.
  <br>
  <br>
  First we do 4 * 4
  <br>
  Next 4 * 3
  <br>
  Next 3 * 4
  <br>
  Next 3* 3
  </p>

  <p> 3 * 4 and 4 * 3 are the same thing, so we are doing double the work.
  Instead, we should just remember that is 12, so when we see it again we
  can immediately remember the answer. Well, I won't expect you to remember
  that, but you could get a computer to remember it. That is the idea behind
  dynamic programming. You break a problem down into the simplest possible
  sub-components. Then, you solve each of those sub parts, saving the
  data as you go along. If you ever encounter that problem again, you already
  know the answer!

<h2>NP Complete & Dynamic Programming</h2>
  <h4>NP Complete</h4>
  <p>Think of any problem you like, it could be adding two numbers together
    or determining the number of your friends that will show up to your
    birthday party. I am sure it'll be different than last year. You
    just had bad timing, since your birthday fell in the middle of a spring
    break trip, and they just forgot to invite you. Not a big deal.
  </p>

  <p> Any problem you can think of is in a class of problems. Likely,
    you picked a problem in the P realm, which is to say a computer
    can solve it relatively quickly. Addition, for exmaple, falls into
    this category. There are a set of problems which a computer cannot
    solve quickly, but they can quickly check the answer. Sudoku, is a
    great example of this type of problem.Now, if a problem cannot
    be solved by a computer quickly, then we cannot check an answer
    quickly right?
  </p>

  <p> Wrong! As per usual. Given an incorrect solution to Sudoku, a
  computer can check it very quickly. Unfortuantely, my Sudoku checker is
  not currently working. I think it has to do with the processor, since
  I know the code is right, and there is no way I did not correctly solve
  the puzzle, it was in a children's book. And I am part of MENSA, so...</p>


  <p>Not all NP problems have answers which can be checked relatively
  quickly. If an answer takes a long time to compute, then the problem
  is considered NP Hard. The interesting thing about solving an NP problem
  is that once you quickly solve one of them, the whole class of NP
  problems will be easy to solve. This is sigificant because things like
  protein folding are NP problems, and solving that would help us cure
  cancer. I was thinking about working on it, but I decided that my
  time would be better spent helping you. See what you did? All because
  you want to be a programmer....</p>

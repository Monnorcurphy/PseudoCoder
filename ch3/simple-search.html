    <h2>Basic Searching</h2>
  <h4>Linear Search/Simple Search</h4>
    <p>Let’s say that you woke up in the middle of the night and you
      really needed to talk to someone, but you are a sad, lonely,
      pathetic person, and you don’t have anyone to talk to.
      What would you do? I am asking for a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, if it was me, I would go through the phone book, and just
      call people until someone agreed to talk to me. This is simple
      search or linear search. It is not terribly efficient, but in this
      case, there is not much of a better choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The phone book does not help me find a person to talk to, or my
      friend, whatever. Not the point.   In Big O notation, this search
      method takes O(N) time. Which sometimes is not bad, but it is not
      always the best.
    </p>


</p>
  <h4>Binary Search</h4>
  <p> Let’s go back to the phone book example, and change it slightly.
    Let’s say I was looking for any people named Marky Mark, because
    I want to make fun of their names. Linear search would be a horrible
    way to handle this. Because I would be searching through the As, then
    Bs, etc.   A better solution is to go to the middle of the phone book,
    if the value is higher than M, I would flip halfway towards the front,
    then halfway from there, and so on.  In this way I am cutting the value
    of the input size by half every time. So....
    <br>
    <br>
    N/2 N/4 + N/8….etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those of you who are not inclined to math, probably should
      just quit everything you are doing and become a monk.
      <br>
      <br>
      Just a suggestion.
      <br>
      <br>That pattern is logarithmic. Which is cool and stuff,
      because of math. Go look up logarithms, and learn about them.
      <br>

    </p>
    <p>
      The important take away is that you are looking at something. And
      every time you are cutting the data you are looking at, and cutting
      it in half. This will continue until you reach your solution
      (either you found it or not). But, either way, you are never looking
      at more than half of the data.

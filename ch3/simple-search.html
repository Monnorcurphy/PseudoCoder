    <h2>Basic Searching</h2>
  <h4>Linear Search/Simple Search</h4>
    <p>Simple Search/Linear Search

    Let’s say that you woke up in the middle of the night and you really needed to talk to someone, but you are a sad lonely pathetic person, and you don’t have anyone to talk to. What would you do? I am asking for a friend.

    Well, if it was me, I would go through the phone book, and just call people until someone agreed to talk to me. This is simple search or linear search. It is not terribly efficient, but in this case, there is not much of a better choice.

    The phone book does not help me find a person to talk to, or my friend, whatever. Not the point.   In Big O notation, this search method take O(N) time. Which, sometimes is not bad, but it is not always the best.

  <h4>Binary Search</h4>
  <p>

  Let’s go back to the phone book example, and change it slightly. Let’s say I was looking for any people named Marky Mark, because I want to make fun of their names. Linear search would be a horrible way to handle this. Because I would be searching through the As, then Bs, etc.  A better solution is to go to the middle of the phone book, if the value is higher than M, I would flip halfway towards the front, then halfway from there, and so on.  In this way I am cutting the value of the input size by half every time. So

  N/2 N/4 + N/8….etc.

  For those of you who are not inclined to math, probably should just quit everything you are doing and become a monk. Just a suggestion.

  That pattern is a logarithmic. Which is cool and stuff, because of math. Go look up logarithms, and learn about them. If anyone wants, I will try to explain that.

    <h2>Basic Sorts</h2>
      <p>For all sorting we are going to imagine that you are trapped
        in a prison at the bottom of the ocean, because that is where
        all of you, and your friends belong. But we have some bad news,
        all of you have escaped and managed to get to a cannon.
        <i class='Italics'>booooo hissssss</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        The only way to fire the cannon is to increase the power based
        on the weight of the person getting in, and powering it up is
        faster than lowering the power. So, you have to send everyone
        up in weight order. Everyone is in a line, but it is out of
        order and they look to you for help. What do you do?
      </p>
      <p>
      <h4>Bubble Sort</h4>
      <p>If you managed to think quickly, it might only take you half a
        day to come up with this idea. You are going going to go up to
        every person. If they weigh less than the person next to them,
        I will push them up towards the front, until they are where they
        are supposed to be. Because you are a fool, you have to go
        through one final time to make sure everyone is in correct
        order.
      </p>

      <p>This, is bubble sort. Congrats! You wasted most of the day to
        come up with one of the most inefficient sorting algorithms. I
        hope you and your ilk are thrown back in prison. The Big O,
        in fact the BEST CASE, of this is N^2, so bad. Like real bad.
        Like give up and live in a nature, don’t go near a computer.
        You are bad. Stop.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is possible to modify bubble sort so that it stops when it
        is fully sorted, which means, in the best case it goes to O(N),
        but it remains a Big O of N^2.
      </p>



      </p>
    <h4>Selection Sort</h4>
      <p> Let’s say you decide that your other method is no good.
        Drats, you might actually escape. But, thankfully for the prison
        guards, your next go to method is this. You go through all of
        your friends, finding the lowest weight, and placing them at the
        front. And you continue to do this until everyone is in the right
        order.
      </p>
    <p>  
      Slightly more efficient, since you don’t have to go through every
      friend one last time at the end (like bubble sort) and, you are
      only searching a smaller group of friends. Since the friends at the
      beginning already belong there, you don’t need to search them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Big O notation of this would still be O(N^2)
    </p>

    <h4>Insertion Sort</h4>
      <p>
        Abandoning those two ideas as fruitless, you exclaim to your
        friends ‘I HAVE GOT IT!’ and propose the following. You
        realize that what made selection sort faster was the fact that
        larger and larger parts of the line were already sorted. So,
        you decide to insert each person where they belong in line.
        You start at the second person, and compare them to the first.
         Doing this over and over again until everyone is in the right
         place.
       </p>
       <p>
         Since the first two are sorted, then the first three, then
         first four, all you have to do is put everyone in their place.
       </p>
       <p>
         Your friends would, hopefully, realize that friendship with you
         is a waste of time and elect a new sorting leader. Can you guess
         the Big O?
         <br>
         <br>
         It's O(N^2).
       </p>

    <h4>Quick Sort</h4>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. </p>
    <h4>Merge Sort</h4>
      <p>Imagine you had to sort three hundred tickets to a ball,
        that you weren’t invited to…again. Well, no worries, maybe if
        you sort this very efficiently, you can go to the ball this
        year, because everyone will be so impressed.
      </p>

      <p>
        What you do is, divide half the tickets into two piles each,
        then divide those piles into halves, and so on, until each pile
        has one ticket. You then sort the piles of tickets by comparing
        piles of one against other piles of one. So, you have ticket 205
        and ticket 40. Ticket 40 goes first, then ticket 205. You do this
        for all piles of one until you have half as many piles of two.
        Now, you do the same problem again for the piles of two. But,
        all the tickets are already sorted, making it much easier.
      </p>

      <p>
        So you look at the first ticket in each pile, then compare their
        values. Put the lowest value in first, then the next greatest
        value, doing this all the way up until you have sorted all 300
        tickets.
      </p>

      <p>So, how long do you think this solution would take?
        <br>
        <br>
      If you thought Big O of n log n, then you are wrong! It’s a Big o
      of n log n, you silly goose. The above implementation I explained
      is actually the “worse” merge sort. If you would like to know the
      better one, it will have it’s own page which you can look at.
      </p>
